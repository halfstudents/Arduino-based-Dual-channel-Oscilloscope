# Arduino-based-Dual-channel-Oscilloscope
It is like a mini atom bomb, In a piece of single code you will get a lot of features and I fully respect the effort of the owner.

I made 2 different oscilloscope and these are featured on this platform. And now I came up with an idea of dual channel oscilloscope. This one has main microcontroller as Arduino and 1.3” OLED display. This time I also have battery operating options and onboard charging circuit also. You can make this on breadboard first and then go with my PCB layouts given below. A big shoutout to JLCPCB to sponsor this project of dual channel Arduino scope.
Features:
The max real time sampling rates are 17.2ksps with 2 channels and 307ksps with a channel. The max equivalent time sampling rates is 16Msps with single channel.
Single-channel -30Khz bandwidth
Onscreen- Volt/Div and Time/Div
Duty cycle monitoring
Small 1.3 inch I2C
AC/DC measurements option
Mode changing, Hold state features
Dual channel Switching mode
Pulse generator option
DDS_PWM waveform generator
Frequency counter
Low battery consumption
Portable and pocket-sized

I got the code in Hex format, but it is confirmed that in the INO Arduino files there are some supporting files. I got my hands on the Arduino INO code of these supporting files. Once I will get the full code, I will share and you would change it by own. Still the HEX file is working properly. If you don’t know how to program Arduino with HEX file then have a look on this tutorial. Download the code for this project from here. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ssX3hNsmni4KX5ha0s1_RhgXTiRkwBpM
